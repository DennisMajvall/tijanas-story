Saga: ”Saga Norén, länskrim, Malmö”
Saga: “Most people use the word interesting when they don't like something, but don't want to say it.”
Tijana: Don't let this show ever end, I love it, and also…. Denmark over Sweden!

Burp:
Tijana: *inaudible burp*
Tijana: *shocked* did you hear it? I just burped!!
Dennis: What? No, I didn't hear anything.
Tijana: I swear it's true 🥺 I did burp just now
Dennis: Hmm, does it really count if it's that quiet? 🤔 I dunno.. (actually just jealous)

Tijana: Oh it was horrible!!! She forced me to bike FOREVER! I was only a child… I'm just a girl.
Natasa: Ahh, you complain too much, it wasn't that long, it was only 1 hour.
Tijana: 1 hour?! What do you mean only 1 hour? That's a shit long time.
Natasa: Come on, no it's not. I remember you whined so much that day.
Tijana: Yeah, I had to use a really shitty bike, it was awful! And for an entire hour as well?! If you had my bike you'd complain too!
Natasa: Meh, it wasn't that bad.
